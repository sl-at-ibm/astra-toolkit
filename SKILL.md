Toolkit for Astra DB and its Data API.

**Astra CLI**: Astra DB only. All other features apply to both Astra DB and HCD (both expose a Data API).

## Astra CLI

Create/list databases, inspect status, prepare a dotenv for app connections.
Requires installation + Database Administrator token.
If missing, direct user to: https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-cli/install.html

→ Details: [astra-cli/README.md](astra-cli/README.md)

## Data API

DDL + DML for Collections and Tables via the HTTP Data API. **Always use Clients — never raw HTTP calls.**
API surface is identical for Astra DB and HCD; only connection setup differs.

## Data modeling

Model data up front, not as an afterthought.

Hierarchy: **Database → Keyspaces → Collections / Tables / UDTs**

- **Collections**: schemaless JSON documents; support find-one-and-update and similar read-then-write primitives.
- **Tables**: typed rows; faster, but no read-then-insert primitives. Different (more) available data types from collections.
- **NoSQL**: no JOINs, no strict transactions, no aggregation pipelines, no group-by, no document-wide full-text search.

Choose collections (flexibility) vs. tables (performance) based on access patterns and the constraints above.

Collections and Tables support vectors and vector/similarity search, including "vectorize" (server-side embedding computations).

## Application architecture

Use the common patterns in [architecture/README.md](architecture/README.md) regardless of language.

## Clients

Use the client object hierarchy (DataAPIClient → Database → Collection/Table → documents/rows) for all DDL and DML.

- API is mostly uniform across languages; mind language-specific idioms and limitations.
- Browse `clients/<language>/README.md` + `examples/` for the target language.
- All examples assume Astra DB; see per-language README for HCD connection code.
- Adapt example comments to the app being built; don't copy them verbatim.
